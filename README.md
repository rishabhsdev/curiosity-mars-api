API to fetch data from Mars curiosity rover.

My previous project [Hello Mars](https://github.com/rishabhsdev/Hello-Mars) was using NASA's public API to fetch Mars data sent by insight rover.

But, Insight Rover stopped sending data few months ago, so I created this API as a workaround to fetch data from Curiosity Rover instead.
